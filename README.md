Titanic Data Analysis Project

Project Description
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to explore survival rates, passenger demographics, and ticket fares. The goal is to answer specific questions about passengers who survived or died, comparing age, fare, gender, and ticket class.

Dataset
The data used is the Titanic training dataset (train.csv) downloaded from Kaggle Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It contains passenger information such as age, sex, ticket fare, class, and survival status.

What is Covered:

Loading and inspecting data
Filtering data using conditions (Boolean masks)
Calculating average and median values
Comparing groups (e.g., males vs females, classes)
Counting filtered data

Results:

The project provides insights such as:
Average ages of passengers who died or survived
Ticket fare averages and medians by survival and class
Death rates by gender
Number of survivors
